# Road-Safety-and-Health-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing datasets related to road safety and health using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data visualization. It explores the relationships between factors such as weather, vehicle types, accidents, casualties, and hospitalization causes. Key findings include:

Impact of Rainfall on Road Accidents: Contrary to assumptions, increased rainfall correlates with fewer accidents.
Accidents vs. Casualties: A positive correlation indicates that more accidents lead to higher casualties.
Vehicle-Specific Analysis: Motorcycles, despite being third in population, account for the highest casualties and fatalities. Motorcars are the most involved in accidents.
Hospitalization Causes: Road accidents rank as the top reason for hospitalizations, highlighting the significant health impact of traffic incidents.
Visualizations include line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and heatmaps to present trends, distributions, and correlations.
